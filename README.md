# iX-DP-defect-synthesization

Possible improvements to make:
- make camera placement uniformly random with respect to bounding sphere
- randomize rotation of object part so that shots from the same angle do not always have the same background
- randomize HDRI background and grunge texture (might have to find a couple more)
- need to fix issue of boolean difference modifier not working properly all the time (can check if object is manifold)
- add noise to pits
